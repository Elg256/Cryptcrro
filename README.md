# Cryptcrro
A cryptography librairie 

This librairie provide ecdsa signature, ecies encryption (using AES from the cryptography librairie for symetric encryption) using Secp256k1 curve. The librairie also provide a symmetric encryption that I call sha256_CTR it is basically a CTR encyprtion mode but using Sha256 instead of AES. (I know it seems weird, but if you are perplexed about encryption with a hashing function pls check the code)
It is the librairie used both in CrroChat and in CrroCoin and will be use in the Crro software at the end.
